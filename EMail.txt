Hi Luis,

Thank you for reaching out. The info is in the metadata section. All the data belongs to the NBA. 

My personal opinion (not a legal advice) is that you should be able to use it for academic purposes.

Let me know how the project goes, I am keen to see the results! 

Regards,
Justinas
